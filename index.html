			Imagine what Minecraft might be like if it had been made with pixel art sprites and released in the SNES
			era. That sums
			up the overall vibe of Terraria pretty well. It also explains why I just can't seem to tear myself away from
			the darned
			thing. This devious little indie sandbox title borrows so many ideas from Notch's game that it essentially
			is Minecraft
			in 2D, but it also beefs up the familiar gameplay in exciting ways. There's a lot more creepy crawly stuff
			to kill, and
			the staggering number of doodads you can MacGyver together into deadly weapons to slay them with is
			mouth-watering. Say
			what you will; there's some gnarly fun to be had in these uncharted depths.

			After you're done customizing your sprite character, Terraria dumps you on the colorful surface of a
			randomly generated
			pixel world with nothing more than a handful of tools and the vague sense that you're meant to build stuff,
			explore the
			terrain, and battle monsters. Figuring out exactly how that's done is a little puzzling at first. There's a
			lone guide
			wandering around the surface, though his advice is random. The lack of a tutorial meant I had to consult the
			game's Wiki
			page to get a better sense of how things work and what can be built. Even so, it didn't take long to get the
			gist.
			Though there aren't any real story elements or epic quests to conquer, the strong fantasy trappings instill
			a desire to
			adventure nonetheless. There's magic, monsters, and mayhem waiting both on the surface and in the dark
			caverns below.
			Uncovering unexpected new prizes and perils is a big part of the game's charm.

			The entire game world is destructible, and breaking block lets you collect core resources like stone, wood,
			and iron
			that can be used to make cool gear or build structures. Rarer resources are dropped when you slay skeletons,
			floating
			fanged critters, and other monsters or when you dig deeper into the subterranean underworld. Since such a
			large portion
			of Terraria's gameplay revolves around foraging for different components and seeing what you can build with
			them, the
			drive to explore every nook and cranny of the landscape kicks in right away. But it's important to temper
			your desire to
			set out exploring in hopes of amassing huge quantities of loot with the pressing need to build shelter and
			expand your
			spawn point's home base.

			Life on the surface follows a day/night cycle. Exploring topside during the daytime is safer – you can pick
			flowers,
			roam around, chop trees, and kill weak slimes that roam too close. It's also a perfect time to build houses
			that serve
			as shelter and attract helpful NPC characters to your settlement. Things get dicey when night falls; zombie
			hordes and
			floating eyeball beasts come out in droves, forcing you to fight or flee. That's less of an issue once you
			get a sturdy
			settlement started.

			The village development aspect of the game is a clever addition – once you discover it exists. You can throw
			together
			bare-bones shacks or craft elaborate fortresses that tower upward into the heavens. Either way, you want to
			deck them
			out with enough accoutrements to lure NPCs to your village. These support characters can heal you, sell you
			items, and
			offer other helpful services. You have to complete a specific task to attract them, and even then they only
			appear if
			you've created a room (complete with walls, furniture, lighting, etc.) for them to stay. This offers some
			tangible
			incentives to spend time building, beyond the desire to lord over a large stronghold.
		</p>

		<p class="post__text">
			Having an elaborate and ever-expanding home base to return to on the surface is satisfying. However, the
			dark,
			foreboding underworld is where the real action is. Everything you need to make the most basic items like
			torches,
			furniture, and healing potions can be found near the surface, but you have to adventure deep below to
			uncover the rarest
			materials. This is where Terraria's gameplay feels more like an old-school action platformer and where it
			really sunk
			its hooks into me. Digging for ore eventually uncovers sprawling caverns that are home to many varieties of
			creepy
			creatures. Giant slimes, skeletons, burrowing worms, and tougher beasties roam the dark, and they often come
			charging at
			you while you're excavating. Exploring is a lot fun on its own, yet it's the strong emphasis on combat
			that's really
			appealing. For one thing, stopping to battle monsters breaks up the monotony of digging. Creatures also drop
			coins that
			can be used to buy shop items. There's an added risk versus reward element to combat too. Getting killed
			causes you to
			re-spawn on the surface with your gear intact, but you'll leave a chunk of your precious coin stash behind.

			The real impetus behind adventuring is driven by the insanely deep gear crafting system. Almost everything
			you pick up
			in the game is a component used in forging some crucial piece of kit. There are well over a hundred
			different weapons
			and items to build. Though some equipment is more functional – like protective armor, grappling hooks that
			lets you
			navigate with greater ease, and treasure chests for storing loot – most of the stuff designed for cleaving
			monsters into
			itty bits is just sheer badass. Magical boomerangs, laser pistols, spell books that shoot fireballs, light
			sabers, and
			ninja stars are just a handful of the crazier weapons you can build. Hunting down the rare items you need to
			build the
			best weapons is obsession forming.
		</p>

		<p class="post__text">
			A few other cool nuances enhance the absorbing tasks of exploring, building, and battling away. Journey to
			the farther
			reaches of the surface world, and you'll inevitably run into The Corruption – a teeming mass of demonic turf
			filled with
			extra danger and extra rewards. You'll also uncover demonic altars for forging special items that can be
			used to summon
			one of the game's three spectacular bosses to fight (sporting awesome names like "Skeletron" and "Eater of
			Worlds").
			Terraria's multiplayer mode is a blast too. Co-operatively exploring and building with friends or strangers
			is even more
			enjoyable than going solo, depending on the folks you play with. Finding an open public server to play on is
			a real
			drag, since most fill up within minutes of being posted on the game's forum. The good news is you can create
			your own
			server and share it with your pals (or post it online for others to join).
